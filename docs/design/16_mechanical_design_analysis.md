# 16 — Mechanical Design and Analysis (CAD / FEA Centerpiece)

**Status: historical model-based study; no measured mast assembly.** Tube,
sleeve and clamp CAD were accepted in [PR #55](https://github.com/500ft/autonomous-racing-systems/pull/55).
D2 still decides mounting need and physical scope; see [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md).
The frequency guard does not establish motor-vibration clearance (section 6.1).
The optical-height assumption in section 7 is incomplete. Neither calculation
releases a mounting height or fabrication task.

**Model baseline retained:** the 0.175 kg tip mass replaces the old 0.20 kg placeholder, raising modeled frequency margin and strength SF. Items 13–15 informed the July 7 mass budget (≈4.42 kg against ≤4.5 kg) and component selections; manufacturing tolerances and per-component CG locations still require CAD/inspection. This status correction does not regenerate those model results.

**Input scope.** Items 13-15 provide the historical model and catalog assumptions.
The analyzed specimen is preserved. Future mounting geometry and physical inputs
remain subject to D2 and inspection; the design tables do not establish an
as-built vehicle.

**Load-case philosophy — replace the placeholder 4g.** The old item-10 spec used an arbitrary **4g** load. **Do not use 4g.** The governing *maneuvering* case is **derived from this project's own telemetry**:

```
F_lateral, governing = m_LiDAR_tip × a_lat,peak × SF
```

where `a_lat,peak` is the **simulated peak lateral acceleration** from the ride-quality race metrics added in commit `9e603d0` — `max_abs_lat_accel_mps2` from `summarize_run` / `race_and_report` in `gym/roboracer/closed_loop.py` — `m_LiDAR_tip` is the LiDAR tip mass from item 15, and `SF` is a stated safety factor. A **separate crash / drop case** is analyzed independently (it is not a steady maneuvering load and should not be blended into the maneuvering case).

> **Peak lateral acceleration from a clean completed simulator lap.** `a_lat,peak = 19.4 m/s²` (≈ 2.0 g), the `max_abs_lat_accel_mps2` reported by `summarize_run` for a **clean completed lap** (`completed_lap == True`, `collision == False`) of the **tuned pure-pursuit baseline** (lookahead 1.2 m, velocity gain 1.2 — the single `selected_baseline == True` row in `runs/pure_pursuit_sweep/results.csv`). Conditions: **RK4 integrator, `dt = 0.002 s`, controller at 100 Hz**, `examples/example_map`; lap time 38.04 s, mean speed 8.33 m/s. Companion figures from the same lap: `mean_abs_lat_accel_mps2 = 5.78`, `max_abs_long_accel_mps2 = 9.51`, `rms_lat_jerk_mps3 = 22.1`. Reproduce with `experiments/ride_quality_baseline.py`; the run is committed to `runs/ride_quality_baseline/` (`summary.json` + per-step `telemetry.csv`). The discarded `runs/first_lap/telemetry.csv` figures (max |a_y| ≈ 78 m/s², max |a_x| ≈ 801 m/s²) are **raw scripted-lap / collision spikes** and were deliberately **not** used.

## 2. Mass and CG Budget — masses LOCKED (2026-07-07); CG locations = CAD deliverable

> Masses are locked from the item-14/15 part selections (vendor/datasheet where published, **ASSUMED** where stated). Per-component CG coordinates (x, y, z) are the **first output of the parametric CAD** (next work item): they require the deck layout — which must also place the R-14 transponder bay (≥ 8 × 12 cm, front half, clear above) — so they are deliberately not guessed here. Total mass traces to R-11.

| Item | Mass (kg) | Basis |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Rolling chassis, TRA68086-4 as shipped (incl. motor, stock ESC, servo, body) | 2.640 | vendor spec (93.1 oz) |
| − body shell + spoiler (removed) | −0.150 | **ASSUMED** — weigh at teardown |
| − stock VXL-3s ESC + receiver (removed) | −0.090 | **ASSUMED** — weigh at teardown |
| + VESC 6 MkVI | +0.120 | **ASSUMED** — vendor publishes dims (75×70×18 mm) but not mass; weigh on receipt |
| + platform deck + standoffs | +0.300 | **ASSUMED** — laser-cut plate per the standard build; CAD replaces with exact material volume |
| + LiDAR mast (recommended geometry, §3.2) | +0.024 | hand calc (23.5 g; L=100 mm, OD=20 mm, t=1.5 mm, 6061-T6) |
| + LiDAR tip package (UST-10LX + bracket + cable) | +0.175 | item 15 §1.2 (LOCKED: 0.130 datasheet + 0.045 ASSUMED allowances) |
| + Jetson Orin NX 16 GB + J401 carrier, heatsink, case | +0.450 | **ASSUMED** — assembled mass not published; weigh on receipt |
| + drive battery (Traxxas 2872X, 3S 5 000 mAh) | +0.376 | vendor spec (13.3 oz) |
| + compute battery (Traxxas 2872X) | +0.376 | vendor spec |
| + 12 V regulator + fuses + wiring harness | +0.150 | **ASSUMED** allowance |
| **Total (ready to race)** | **≈ 4.42** | sum — **within the R-11 ≤ 4.5 kg budget** (margin 0.08 kg, thin; the ASSUMED rows carry the uncertainty) |

> **Honest deviations, stated:** (1) 4.42 kg vs the identified model's `m = 3.74 kg` (**+18%**) — one more reason the sim `C_Sf`/`C_Sr` do **not** transfer to hardware (item 14 §5); the item-14 §3 tractive sizing was computed at 4.42 kg, not 3.74. (2) The model CG height `h = 0.074 m` (`dynamics.py`) will be exceeded by the real deck + mast build — quantify at CAD and check the rollover margin at the 19.4 m/s² lateral envelope then. (3) Six rows are ASSUMED; each is replaced by a scale measurement at build (item 17) or CAD volume (deck) — the budget is honest about where its ±0.1 kg-class uncertainty lives.

## 3. LiDAR Mast — Free-Body Diagram + Hand Calculation (REQUIRED)

> TEMPLATE / TODO. Required deliverable: a labeled FBD of the mast as a cantilever with the LiDAR mass at the tip, loaded by `F_lateral, governing = m_LiDAR_tip × a_lat,peak × SF` applied at the optical-center height (moment arm). Hand-calc bending stress and tip deflection from beam theory:
- Bending moment at root: $M = F_\mathrm{lateral}\, h_\mathrm{arm}$
- Max bending stress: $\sigma = Mc/I$
- Tip deflection: $\delta = F_\mathrm{lateral} L^3 / (3EI)$

Record the section (I, c), the numbers, and the margin against σ_yield. **This hand calc is the ground truth the FEA must match.** Also run the **crash/drop case** as a separate FBD/hand calc.

> Values below are for the **recommended (frequency-fix) geometry** (§3.2; L=100 mm, OD=20 mm, t=1.5 mm 6061-T6) with the **firmed 0.175 kg** tip mass. The **crash case governs strength** (50 g) and is tabulated here; the maneuvering case (2 g) is far milder (σ ≈ 3.0 MPa). Full both-case numbers are in §3.1.

| Quantity | Symbol | Value (crash, recommended geom.) | Note |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Governing crash force | F | **128.8 N** | = m_LiDAR_tip × 50 g × SF_crash (0.175 kg × 490 m/s² × 1.5); **a_lat,peak = 19.4 m/s² known**; m_LiDAR_tip **firmed 0.175 kg** (item 15) |
| Moment arm | h_arm | **0.100 m** | optical-center height = mast length |
| Root bending moment | M | **12.88 N·m** | F × h_arm = 128.76 N × 0.100 m (corrected 2026-09-19; 15.45 N·m belongs to the rejected 120 mm baseline in §3.1) |
| Section modulus / I, c | — | **I = 3754 mm⁴, c = 10.0 mm** | recommended OD=20 mm tube |
| Hand-calc max stress | σ_hand | **34.3 MPa** | M·c/I (crash, root) |
| Hand-calc tip deflection | δ_hand | **0.166 mm** | F·L³/(3EI) (crash) |
| Margin vs yield | — | **8.05** | σ_yield / σ_hand (crash; PASS ≥ 1.5) |

### 3.1 Hand calculation (analytical baseline)

> Closed-form baseline, re-run on the **firmed item-15 tip mass**. The mast is
> modeled as a **thin-walled 6061-T6 aluminum cantilever tube**, fixed at the
> deck (root) with the LiDAR mass lumped at the free tip (moment arm = full
> length). Reproduce with `experiments/mast_hand_calc.py`; raw output is in
> `runs/mast_hand_calc/summary.txt`. **The tip mass is now FIRMED at 0.175 kg**
> (item 15 §1.2: Hokuyo UST-10LX 0.130 kg datasheet + 0.030 kg bracket + 0.015 kg
> cable); geometry and material remain engineering choices (labelled ASSUMED).
> The measured `a_lat,peak = 19.4 m/s²` is a non-assumed input. **The firmed
> 0.175 kg is lighter than the prior 0.20 kg placeholder, so f1 rose and stress
> fell — verified below.**

**Assumptions block (all ASSUMED unless noted):**

| Parameter | Value | Basis |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Mast length `L` (= moment arm `h_arm`) | 0.120 m | ASSUMED — short mast, tip at free end (conservative lever) |
| Tube OD | 16.0 mm | ASSUMED — stock aluminum tube |
| Wall thickness `t` | 1.50 mm | ASSUMED → ID 13.0 mm |
| Section: `I` = π/64·(OD⁴−ID⁴), `c` = OD/2 | I = 1.815×10⁻⁹ m⁴ (1815 mm⁴), c = 8.0 mm | derived |
| Material | 6061-T6 Al: E = 68.9 GPa, σ_yield = 276 MPa, ρ = 2700 kg/m³ | ASSUMED — carbon tube is the lighter/stiffer alternative but anisotropic with no single yield; Al is the conservative baseline |
| Tip mass `m_tip` | **0.175 kg** | **FIRMED (item 15 §1.2)** — Hokuyo UST-10LX 0.130 kg [datasheet] + 0.030 kg bracket + 0.015 kg cable |
| Maneuver accel `a_lat,peak` | 19.4 m/s² (≈ 2.0 g) | **MEASURED** — clean lap, `runs/ride_quality_baseline` |
| Crash shock | 50 g = 490 m/s² | ASSUMED — stated half-sine-equivalent survival shock; bounds a low-speed bench drop and deliberately governs strength over the ~2 g maneuvering case |
| Safety factors | SF_maneuver = 2.0, SF_crash = 1.5 | ASSUMED — 2.0 on yield for the repeated maneuvering load; 1.5 on top of the already-inflated 50 g crash |

**Results — both load cases** (cantilever, tip point load `F = m_tip·a·SF`, fixed root):

_Baseline geometry (L=120 mm, OD=16 mm, t=1.5 mm), firmed 0.175 kg tip:_

| Quantity | Maneuvering (2 g, SF 2.0) | Crash (50 g, SF 1.5) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Tip force `F` | 6.79 N | 128.76 N |
| Root moment `M = F·L` | 0.815 N·m | 15.45 N·m |
| Max bending stress `σ = M·c/I` | 3.59 MPa | 68.10 MPa |
| Tip deflection `δ = F·L³/(3EI)` | 0.031 mm | 0.593 mm |
| Yield margin `σ_yield/σ` | **76.9** (PASS, ≥2.0) | **4.05** (PASS, ≥1.5) |

The **crash case governs strength** (σ ≈ 68 MPa vs 4 MPa); both clear yield with margin. Stress is modest because a 16 mm tube is over-stiff in bending for these loads — strength is not the binding constraint. (The firmed 0.175 kg tip lowered the crash stress from the 0.20 kg-placeholder 77.8 → 68.1 MPa, lifting the crash SF 3.55 → 4.05.)

**First natural frequency** (load-independent; Rayleigh tip-mass model):

| Quantity | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| `k_eff = 3EI/L³` | 2.171×10⁵ N/m |
| `m_eff = m_tip + 0.23·m_mast` (m_mast = 22.1 g) | 180.1 g |
| `f1 = (1/2π)·√(k_eff/m_eff)` | **174.7 Hz** |

**Historical selection criterion:** the hand baseline fell below the original
frequency threshold in [summary.txt](../../runs/mast_hand_calc/summary.txt).
The claimed motor-band clearance was subsequently withdrawn by section 6.1.
This records the geometry-selection history, not a current fabrication requirement.

> The hand calculation is an analytical comparison under its stated idealizations.
> The modal attachment audit qualifies comparison with the historical FE deck.

### 3.2 Design revision — frequency fix (REQUIRED: the baseline FAILS modal)

Under the historical criterion, the §3.1 baseline **passed strength but failed the modal guard band** (`f1 = 174.7 Hz < 200 Hz`, on the firmed 0.175 kg tip mass). A design sweep over mast geometry and material was run to find a configuration that clears `f1 ≥ 200 Hz` with comfortable margin while keeping the crash-case yield safety factor acceptable. Reproduce with `python experiments/mast_hand_calc.py`; raw output in `runs/mast_hand_calc/design_sweep.txt`.

**Sweep space:** length `L ∈ {0.12 … 0.08} m`, outer diameter `OD ∈ {16 … 25} mm`, wall `t ∈ {1.0, 1.5, 2.0} mm`, material ∈ {6061-T6 aluminum, CFRP}. For every candidate the sweep recomputes `f1 = (1/2π)·√(3EI/(L³·m_eff))` with `m_eff = m_tip + 0.23·m_mast`, and the **governing crash-case** stress/SF.

> **CFRP alternative (clearly-stated assumed properties):** a roll-wrapped/pultruded carbon-fiber tube, axial modulus depends strongly on layup (≈ 70–130 GPa); the sweep assumes **E = 100 GPa, ρ = 1600 kg/m³**. CFRP is **anisotropic with no single tensile yield**, so a "yield SF" is not strictly defined — it is screened only against a **conservative 600 MPa bending allowable** (well below ultimate ≈ 1.5–2 GPa). **Aluminum remains the recommended baseline** because its yield is well-defined; CFRP is the lighter upgrade path if mast mass ever becomes binding.

**Recommended revised mast:** **6061-T6 aluminum, L = 100 mm, OD = 20 mm, wall t = 1.5 mm (stock).** This uses **both** stiffness levers (modestly shorter `L`, larger `OD`), keeps the stock 1.5 mm wall and the well-defined-yield aluminum, and only trims `L` by 20 mm (preserving the LiDAR optical-center height / sightline over the compute stack) — most of the stiffness budget is spent on diameter.

| Quantity | **Baseline (FAILS)** | **Recommended (PASSES)** |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Geometry | L=120 mm, OD=16 mm, t=1.5 mm | **L=100 mm, OD=20 mm, t=1.5 mm** |
| Material | 6061-T6 Al | 6061-T6 Al |
| Section `I` | 1815 mm⁴ | **3754 mm⁴** (×2.07) |
| `k = 3EI/L³` | 2.17×10⁵ N/m | **7.76×10⁵ N/m** (×3.58) |
| **`f1` (Rayleigh, 0.175 kg tip)** | **174.7 Hz → FAIL** (< 200) | **330.1 Hz → PASS** (1.65× the 200 Hz guard; 3.3× the 100 Hz control rate) |
| Crash-case `σ` | 68.1 MPa | **34.3 MPa** |
| **Crash-case SF** vs yield | 4.05 (PASS) | **8.05 (PASS)** |
| Crash tip deflection | 0.593 mm | 0.166 mm |
| Mast self-mass | 22.1 g | 23.5 g (**+1.4 g**) |

**Why it works (stiffness rises far faster than mass).** Because the 0.175 kg tip mass dominates `m_eff` (mast self-mass ≈ 0.02 kg), `m_eff` is nearly constant and `f1 ≈ √(3EI/L³)`. The two levers attack `k = 3EI/L³` directly:
- **Shorter `L`:** $k \propto L^{-3}$, so 120→100 mm raises $k$ by $(120/100)^3 = 1.73\times$ ($f_1 \propto L^{-1.5}$) at essentially **zero mass cost**.
- **Larger `OD`:** for a thin wall $I \propto \mathrm{OD}^3 t$, so 16→20 mm raises $I$ by $2.07\times$, while the extra material it adds to `m_eff` is second-order (tip mass dominates).

Together they lift `k` by `3.58×` and `f1` from 174.7 → 330.1 Hz. The same geometry change **also lowers** the crash stress (more `I` ⇒ less `M·c/I`), so the fix is **monotonic in both checks** — strength margin actually improves (SF 4.05 → 8.05). The same 100 mm/20 mm tube in CFRP would reach ≈ 400 Hz at ≈ 14 g, but aluminum is kept for its defined yield.

**Hand sanity-check of the recommended $f_1$:** $I = \frac{\pi}{64}(20^4 - 17^4) = 3754\ \mathrm{mm^4}$; $k = 3 \cdot 68.9\times10^{9} \cdot 3.754\times10^{-9} / 0.1^3 = 7.76\times10^5\ \mathrm{N/m}$; $m_\mathrm{eff} = 0.175 + 0.23 \cdot 0.0235 = 0.1804\ \mathrm{kg}$; $f_1 = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{7.76\times10^5 / 0.1804} = 330.1\ \mathrm{Hz}$. ✔ matches the sweep.

> **Historical FEA result retained.** The [committed comparison](../../runs/mast_fea/fea_summary.txt)
> lies within the selected hand/FEA comparison band. This is model-to-model
> agreement. The attachment-model audit and motor-order assessment below
> qualify the modal interpretation; physical validation remains absent.

## 4. Static FEA vs Hand Calc (REQUIRED)

> **DONE for the recommended geometry (§3.2), re-run on the firmed 0.175 kg tip mass.** Static FEA was run on the recommended mast (L=100 mm, OD=20 mm, t=1.5 mm, 6061-T6) with the **crash** load (**128.8 N** = 0.175 kg × 50 g × 1.5) and a fixed (ENCASTRE) root, via `experiments/mast_fea.py` (gmsh C3D10 mesh → CalculiX `ccx`). The crash load is **distributed over the tip-ring nodes** (a single-node point load creates a non-physical nodal singularity); stress is compared on a **mid-span gauge ring** (away from the fixed root and the load) where elementary `M·c/I` applies, plus the global tip deflection. Mesh: 58 232 nodes / 28 985 quadratic tets, element size ≈ 1.2 mm. Raw results in `runs/mast_fea/fea_summary.txt`; toolchain in `docs/design/FEA_SETUP.md`.

| Quantity | Hand calc | FEA | Δ% | Within ±15%? |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Tip deflection (crash) | 0.166 mm | 0.176 mm | +5.9% | **YES** |
| Mid-span gauge stress (crash) | 17.1 MPa | 17.4 MPa | +1.3% | **YES** |

> The fixed-root **peak** von Mises (41.9 MPa) is a re-entrant-corner stress concentration / mesh singularity, **not** a valid `M·c/I` comparison (root beam-theory `M·c/I` = 34.3 MPa) — which is exactly why the §5 mesh-convergence metric and the comparison above use a defined gauge region and the global deflection, not the peak nodal stress. Tip deflection (+5.9%) and gauge stress (+1.3%) both fall well inside the ±15% band, so the static model-to-model comparison meets that band.

## 5. Mesh Convergence (REQUIRED, <5%)

> **DONE — PASS.** Three uniform refinements (~1.5× each) of the recommended mast, solved for the static crash case **and** the first bending mode via `python experiments/mast_fea.py --converge` (raw table: `runs/mast_fea/mesh_convergence.txt`). The gauge band is held **fixed** (z = L/2 ± 1.0 mm) across all levels so every mesh samples the same physical region — letting the band scale with element size would change the comparison region between levels and contaminate the convergence measure. Acceptance: <5% change in gauge stress (and tip deflection and f1) between the two finest meshes.

| Mesh level | Element size / count | Gauge stress | Δ% | Tip defl. | Δ% | f1 | Δ% |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Coarse | 3.0 mm / 4 747 C3D10 | 17.38 MPa | — | 0.1772 mm | — | 290.6 Hz | — |
| Medium | 2.0 mm / 10 435 C3D10 | 17.50 MPa | +0.70% | 0.1751 mm | −1.15% | 289.6 Hz | −0.35% |
| Fine | 1.2 mm / 28 985 C3D10 | 17.48 MPa | **−0.15%** | 0.1757 mm | **+0.30%** | 285.5 Hz | **−1.42%** |

All three metrics move by <1.5% at the final refinement — an order of magnitude inside the 5% acceptance band, so the 1.2 mm production mesh used in §4/§6 is converged for the quantities being reported. (The global *peak* von Mises at the fixed-root corner is deliberately **not** tracked here: it sits on a re-entrant-corner singularity and diverges with refinement, which is exactly why the acceptance metric is defined on the gauge region.)

## 6. Modal Analysis

The [historical modal output](../../runs/mast_fea/fea_summary.txt) uses a
fixed root and one translational mass attached to a tube-wall node. The
[attachment study](../../runs/mast_modal_attachment_20260925/study.json) separates
coupling from eccentric position and explains much of the hand/FEA gap.
Its centred coupled result is unconverged and unadopted. Both original models
fix the root, so root flexibility cannot explain their difference. The
remaining discrepancy has no established physical attribution.

The old frequency threshold was met numerically. It does not establish
motor-vibration clearance, as the assessment below shows.

### 6.1 Retrospective assessment — is the 200 Hz guard the right criterion? (audit F1)

> **Added 2026-09-25 by [the engineering audit](../ENGINEERING_AUDIT.md). This is a retrospective
> assessment of an existing threshold, not a recovery of the original reasoning, and it changes no
> criterion.** Reproduce: `python3 experiments/drivetrain_excitation.py`.

**Engineering question.** The guard is stated as: clear the 100 Hz control rate *and* "a plausible
low-hundreds-Hz motor/drivetrain excitation band" by 2×, hence `f1 ≥ 200 Hz`. The frequency ratio to the control rate is an arithmetic comparison; it does
not establish a structural excitation requirement. What frequency does this drivetrain actually produce?

**Inputs** — every one already derived elsewhere in this repository; none introduced here.

| Symbol | Value | Provenance | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `n_m` at 10 m/s | 20 600 rpm | calculated result | §14 §2 (1 744 rpm wheel × 11.82) |
| `n_0` no-load, 3S | 38 850 rpm | calculated result | §14 §2 (3 500 kV × 11.1 V) |
| `n_w` at 10 m/s | 1 744 rpm | calculated result | §14 §2 |
| `v_max` | 10 m/s | requirement | the speed §14's table is derived at |
| `f1` FEA | 285.5 Hz | calculated result | `runs/mast_fea/fea_summary.txt` |
| guard | 200 Hz | **selected value** | §3.1 — the number under assessment |

**Assumptions and validity limits.** First-order shaft frequency is `f = n/60`; that is exact. Whether
it *excites* the mast depends on rotor unbalance, the motor→chassis→deck→mast transmission path, and
damping. **None of those is recorded**, so this block bounds frequencies only, not amplitudes.

**Model.** `f_shaft(v) = (n_m/60)·(v/v_max)`, linear in road speed. The crossing speed at which shaft
order equals a target is `v_cross = v_max·f_target/(n_m/60)`.

**Substitution.**
`f_shaft(10) = (20 600/60)·1 = 343.3 Hz` · `f_shaft_no-load = 38 850/60 = 647.5 Hz` ·
`v_cross(285.5) = 10·285.5/343.3 = 8.32 m/s` · `v_cross(200) = 10·200/343.3 = 5.83 m/s`

**Unit check.** rpm ÷ 60 → rev/s = Hz. `v_max·Hz/Hz` → m/s. Both consistent.

**Result.**

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| First-order shaft at 10 m/s | **343.3 Hz**, i.e. **1.20× above** the 285.5 Hz mode |
| Wheel order at 10 m/s | 29.1 Hz |
| Road speed where shaft order meets the FEA mode | **8.32 m/s** |
| Road speed where shaft order crosses the 200 Hz guard | **5.83 m/s** |

**Sensitivity.** All of it scales linearly with road speed, so the conclusion is not sensitive to a
small speed error. It *is* sensitive to `f1`: at the 330.1 Hz hand value the crossing moves to 9.6 m/s,
still inside the envelope.

**What this shows.** The guard was justified as clearing an excitation band *upward* by 2×. This
drivetrain's first-order shaft excitation sits **above** the mast mode at speed and **sweeps up through
it at about 8.3 m/s**, inside the operating envelope. The reported "1.43× margin over 200 Hz" is a
margin against a number that does not describe this drivetrain.

**What this does not show.** That the mast is inadequate. A resonance swept through with low unbalance
and ordinary damping may be entirely harmless. **No amplitude claim is made or implied.**

**Decision.** None taken here. The criterion stands unchanged pending the missing inputs below.

**Validation / next inputs.** Status: **unresolved**. Required before this becomes an excitation
assessment rather than a frequency comparison:

| Missing input | Unlocks | How |
|---|---|---|
| Motor pole pairs | commutation-order frequencies | datasheet, or count stator teeth and magnets |
| Spur / pinion tooth counts | gear-mesh frequency | the part numbers already in §14's BOM |
| Rotor unbalance class | whether first order carries energy | vendor spec, or a bench run |
| Motor→deck transmission | mast-base input amplitude | bench measurement only; not calculable |

Two honest routes once those exist: re-derive the guard from a real excitation spectrum, or restate it
as a control-rate guard and record the drivetrain question as open. Widening the band to make the
present design pass is not one of them.

## 7. Tolerance Stack → LiDAR Angular Error (REQUIRED)

> **Historical tolerance calculation with incomplete optical-height input.**
> The [saved output](../../runs/mast_tolerance_stack/summary.txt) assumes optical
> height equals deck height plus mast length. Bracket geometry and the sensor's
> base-to-optical offset are missing. The table and sensitivity below retain
> their original assumptions and verdicts; they are not released design limits.
> No scan-plane levelling or moving-car pitch/roll measurement has been made.

| Contributor | Tolerance | Angular contribution | Note |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Deck local flatness (20 mm base seat) | 0.10 mm / 20 mm | 0.286° | ASSUMED, machined/FR4-plate class |
| Mast base-to-tube squareness | — | 0.500° | ASSUMED FDM-bracket class, no post-machining |
| Bolted-joint preload rocking | — | 0.100° | clearance goes to yaw (software-nulled); tilt allowance kept |
| LiDAR internal scan-plane-to-base | — | 0.250° | ASSUMED — datasheet does not spec it |
| LiDAR mounting datum | 0.10 mm / 40 mm | 0.143° | ASSUMED bolt-pattern flatness |
| Elastic tilt @ 2g maneuvering | FEA-derived | 0.004° | negligible — stack is interface-dominated |
| **Worst-case sum (blind assembly)** | — | **1.284°** | **FAIL** vs 0.458° |
| **RSS (blind assembly)** | — | **0.652°** | **FAIL** vs 0.458° — at the realistic deck height even the RSS blind build is out |
| **Worst-case after scan-plane leveling** | — | **0.354°** | **PASS**, 1.29× margin at the 0.120 m deck estimate |

Beam-height error: ±5.7 cm (RSS, blind) / ±3.1 cm (calibrated worst) at 5 m; ±11.4 / ±6.2 cm at 10 m.

**Margin is deck-height-dependent (sensitivity in the run output):** the up-tilt bound tightens as the deck rises — 2.10× margin at 0.070 m (old, infeasible), 1.29× at the 0.120 m baseline, 1.00× at 0.138 m, FAIL by 0.150 m. Hence:

**Current interpretation:** installation levelling may address static tilt,
but the original deck-height bound depends on an incomplete optical stack.
D2 must establish the required scan planes, obstructions and pitch/roll envelope
and then select a mount using actual bracket and sensor geometry. The historical
tube length is an analysis specimen, not a demonstrated vehicle requirement.

## 8. Design Page(s)

> TEMPLATE / TODO. One polished design page per major part (chassis plate, sensor deck, LiDAR mast): CAD render, key dimensions, governing load case + result, FEA contour, modal result, and the tolerance budget. Export figures to `docs/design/figures/`.

## 9. Checklist

- [x] Mass & CG budget — **masses filled (§2, ≈ 4.42 kg vs ≤ 4.5 kg R-11)**; CG coordinates = first CAD output
- [x] FBD + hand calc, maneuvering case derived from telemetry, NOT 4g (§3.1)
- [x] FBD + hand calc, separate crash/drop case (§3.1; crash governs strength)
- [x] **Design revision — frequency fix** (§3.2): baseline `f1=174.7 Hz` (firmed 0.175 kg tip) FAILED the ≥200 Hz guard; recommended **L=100 mm / OD=20 mm / t=1.5 mm 6061-T6** → `f1=330.1 Hz`, crash SF 8.05 (both PASS)

- [x] Mesh convergence <5% on the gauge region (`experiments/mast_fea.py --converge`: <1.5% on gauge stress / tip deflection / f1 at final refinement — PASS; `runs/mast_fea/mesh_convergence.txt`)
- [x] Historical modal solve recorded (§6); motor-clearance claim withdrawn (§6.1)
- [x] Historical tolerance calculation recorded (§7); incomplete optical-height input prevents release of its deck-height bound
- [ ] Vehicle mounting release, as-built CG and tolerances remain gated by D2; existing tube/sleeve/clamp CAD is recorded above
- [ ] Polished design page per part
- [x] **FEA toolchain stood up and tested** (gmsh 4.15.2 + CalculiX 2.23 `ccx`); commands in `docs/design/FEA_SETUP.md`, pipeline `experiments/mast_fea.py`
