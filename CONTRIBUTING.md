# Contributing

Sim-to-Real Controller Ranking follows the [dependency roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
Archive qualification is complete; empirical ranking work remains gated.
The repository retains a legacy simulator, a portable telemetry/report toolchain,
ROS 2 integration, and generated research artifacts. Use the environment that
matches the part you are changing.

## Current qualification environment

Use Python 3.11 with `requirements-ope-qualification.txt` and the commands in
[the qualification report](reports/ope_qualification.md#reproduce). Historical
work-order ledgers no longer activate tasks or gate CI.

## Legacy Gym environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate f1tenth-gym
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Portable regression environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-item11-regression.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements-report.txt
```

Run the CI-aligned checks:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/test_rosbag_to_telemetry.py
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/test_bag_evidence.py
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/validate_item11.py
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/test_mast_physical_validation.py
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/test_final_report.py
PYTHONPATH=gym python experiments/test_report_figures.py
```

## Experiment changes

- Keep an experiment, its validation script, generated run data, figure, and
  report synchronized.
- Record whether each parameter is configured, identified from simulator data,
  identified from vehicle data, or measured physically.
- Do not present simulator coefficient recovery as vehicle identification.
- Do not replace pending mast or vehicle measurements with FEA output.
- Keep long MPC and robustness sweeps opt-in in the default pipeline.
- Draw report figures through `experiments/figure_style.py` and, for simulator
  figures, `experiments/report_figures.py`, so type, line styles and sizes stay
  the same across figures. Put words in the generated caption file, not on the canvas.

## ROS 2 changes

Preserve the standard-topic path using `/ego_racecar/odom` and `/drive`.
Project-specific internal state may enrich a simulator study but should not be a
requirement for a normal RoboRacer bag.

## Pull requests

List the environment used, commands run, generated artifacts changed, and
whether the change affects simulation, ROS 2 ingestion, mechanical analysis, or
physical-test preparation.
